# CentralTendency
Welcome to Ben McHugh's Tandem ReactJS Challenge.

In this repository, you will find all the necessary files to run my app. Make sure node/npm is installed on the machine.

# How to run the program

## Backend
Navigate to the server.js file in the backend folder. In a terminal, run the "node server.js" command. The server will then be ready to take requests from the frontend.

## Frontend
Navigate to frontend/statisticsapp and run the command "npm install" on a second terminal window. Once all of the dependencies install, you will be able to run "npm start" and a browser window will open with the application.
